    "This study presents an in-depth analysis of analytics-related occupations within the US labor market, focusing on providing valuable insights to students. Utilizing data mining techniques such as clustering and classification, we examine the trends and statistics of these occupations and offer descriptive analytics, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering. Furthermore, predictive analytics is employed to forecast job postings and other relevant information, enabling students to make informed decisions about their career paths. By analyzing the analytics-related job landscape, this research contributes to informing students about the diverse opportunities available and guiding their professional journey."

    "Exploring analytics-occupations on US Labor Market requires the knowledge on how the labor market are organized in the United States along with its supporting infrastructure and ecosystem. There are three components that support the ecosystem of the labor market in the United States which are:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Industry Classification:** Various industries in the United States are classified into several categories based on their characteristics and nature, and the classifi-cation for these industries adheres to the North American Industry Classification System. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is a stand-ardized system used by Federal statistical agencies in the US to classify business establishments, gather statistical data, and analyze the US business economy. NAICS divides the economy into 20 sectors. Industries within these sectors are grouped according to the production criterion \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Occupation Classification:** The Standard Occupational Classification (or SOC) system is a federal statistical standard employed by federal agencies for classifying workers into occupational categories, aiming to collect, compute, or publish data. Workers are assigned to one of 867 distinct occupations based on their de-scription. Detailed occupations are combined to create 459 broad occupations, 98 minor groups, and 23 major groups, making classification more efficient. Occupations with similar job responsibilities, and sometimes comparable skills, education, and/or training, are grouped in the SOC \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Skills Classification**. There are no official skill classifications from the US gov-ernment but Lightcast, one of the leading labor market aggregators and analytics, has suggested skill classification and definition. The Open Skills Library by Lightcast defines skills as abilities related to particular tasks or knowledge of specific subjects and tools obtained through education or experience. The library categorizes each skill as specialized, common, or certifications. <br> **Specialized Skills**, also known as technical skills or hard skills, are competen-cies that are mostly necessary within a specific occupation or enable an individ-ual to carry out a particular task. Examples of specialized skills include \"NumPy\" or \"Hotel Management\". <br> **Common Skills** refer to the skills widely used across various occupations and industries, encompassing both learned skills and personal attributes. These skills may include \"Communication\" or \"Microsoft Excel\" and are also known as com-petencies, soft skills, or human skills.<br> **Certifications** refer to qualifications that are recognized by industry or educa-tional bodies, such as a \"Cosmetology License\" or a \"Certified Cytotechnologist\" designation. These certifications indicate that the individual has achieved specif-ic knowledge or expertise in a particular field or skill.<br> **Software Skills** refer to the software proficiency that the employer sought after for the particular occupations.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Please note that one occupation could have several job titles under its umbrella, for example, occupation of \"Data Scientists\" could have job titles posted by the employer such as \"Data Scientists\", \"Data Analysts\", and \"Information Analysts\". You could explore various job titles for various occupations later below in this report.\n"

While qualification is \"nice to have\" skills but having an MBA might have amplified the change of acceptance as stipulated by the Qualification data."

    "- The antecedents of the rule are the skills or items that appear on the left-hand side, and in this case, it is '(R (Programming Language))'.\n",
    "- The consequents of the rule are the skills or items that appear on the right-hand side, and in this case, it is '(Python (Programming Language))'.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Support represents the frequency of occurrence of the rule in the dataset, i.e., how often both '(R (Programming Language))' and '(Python (Programming Language))' appear together in job postings.\n",

    "- Confidence measures the conditional probability of finding the consequents ('Python (Programming Language)') in a transaction given that the antecedents ('R (Programming Language)') are present.\n",

    "- A lift greater than 1 indicates a positive association. In this case, the lift is 4.022191, meaning that the co-occurrence of 'R (Programming Language)' and 'Python (Programming Language)' is approximately 4.02 times more likely than if they were independent of each other.\n",

    "**Conviction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conviction quantifies the implication of the rule in terms of how much it is influenced by the absence of the consequents.\n",

When 'R (Programming Language)' is mentioned, there is a relatively high likelihood of 'Python (Programming Language)' being mentioned as well, and the co-occurrence of these skills is more likely than expected by chance.\n"
